# Andrew NG Machine Learning - Assignments with Python!
my solutions to Coursera Machine Learning course, using python

## Assignments

* ex1 - Linear Regression
  * `ex1-oneVariable.ipynb` : Linear regression (one variable), gradient descent and scikit learn
  * `ex1-multipleVariables.ipynb` : Linear regression (multiple variable), gradient descent and scikit learn

* ex2 - Logistic Regression
  * `ex2-NotRegularized.py` : Typical solution to a 2-feature logistic regression problem, using scipy.optimize to minimize the cost function
      ![Alt text](/ex2/ex2-NotRegularized.png)
  * `ex2-Regularized.py` : Solution to a 2-feature logistic regression problem with polynomial features (degree = 6)
      ![Alt text](/ex2/ex2-Regularized.png)
  * `ex2-sklearn.py` : Implemented logistic regression using scikit-learn. first dataset is not regularized and does not include polynomial features, whereas second data set is regularized with polynomial features

* ex3 - Logistic Regression and Neural Networks
  * `ex3-logistic.ipynb` : Multi-Class logistic regression (mnist dataset), using scikit-learn (Method 1) and gradient descent (Method 2)
