# Andrew NG Machine Learning - Assignments with Python!
my solutions to Coursera Machine Learning course, using python

## Assignments

* ex1 - Linear Regression
  * `ex1-oneVariable.ipynb` : Linear regression (one variable), gradient descent and scikit learn
  * `ex1-multipleVariables.ipynb` : Linear regression (multiple variable), gradient descent and scikit learn

* ex2 - Logistic Regression
  * `ex2.ipynb` : Two parts: Not regularized, Regularized (polynomial features), logistic regression using scikit learn is practiced in assignment 3

* ex3 - Logistic Regression and Neural Networks
  * `ex3-logistic.ipynb` : Multi-Class logistic regression (mnist dataset), using gradient descent (Method 1) and scikit learn (Method 2)
  * `ex3-neural.ipynb` : Implementation of forward-propagation in order to find training accuracy of a given neural network

* ex4 - Neural Networks
  * `ex4.ipynb` : A NeuralNetwork class, generalized to whatever network architecture user wants, using fmin_cg to minimize cost function

* ex4 - Reglarized Linear Regression and Bias vs. Variance
  * `ex5.ipynb` : Linear regression with regularization, learning curves, polynomial linear regression with plots
