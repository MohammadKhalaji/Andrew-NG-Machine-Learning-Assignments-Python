# Andrew NG Machine Learning - Assignments with Python!
my solutions to Coursera Machine Learning course, using python

## Assignments

* ex1 - Linear Regression
  * `ex1.py` : Linear regression using Vectorized gradient descent
  * `ex1-Normalequations.py` : Linear regression using Normal equations
  * `ex1-sklearn.py` : Linear regression using scikit-learn learn module

* ex2 - Logistic Regression
  * `ex2-NotRegularized.py` : Typical solution to a 2-feature logistic regression problem, using scipy.optimize to minimize the cost function

  * `ex2-Regularized.py` : Solution to a 2-feature logistic regression problem with polynomial features (degree = 6)
      ![Alt text](/ex2/ex2-Regularized.png)
  * `ex2-skelearn.py` : Implemented logistic regression using scikit-learn. first dataset is not regularized and does not include polynomial features, whereas second data set is regularized with polynomial features
